## What is MBINCompiler?

MBINCompiler is a modding tool for the game: [No Man's Sky](https://www.nomanssky.com/) that converts the game's MBIN data files (binary) into human-readable EXML files (text) that can be edited with any text editor and then converted back again for use in a modded game.

Various MBIN files have different data formats. MBINCompiler maps all of these formats to be able to understand how to read the binary data from file, convert it to EXML and vice versa.
